After a long gap, I would like to shed some light on this topic because now I am pursuing my Masters in Mechatronics and Robotics from the University of Leeds. So I believe that I am in a better position to answer this question.

With connection to my previous post, I would like to move forward with the next big question which most of them ask me that is “I am interested in Robotics what should I do next?”, “Which school is better for robotics?”, “What course should I take to pursue robotics?” And so on… Well if you are looking for the answers to similar questions I would like to give you some tips in this post.

Firstly, this paragraph is for the school students who are interested in learning more about robotics and tinkering with the embedded systems. Interested students can learn the basics of electronics, electrical and coding with a lot of online resources. I will share some interesting websites in the end of this post. I would suggest that instead of getting hands on with readymade “robot kits” please try it the hard way. The hard way means building up basic circuits with a breadboard and playing with LED programs and motors. Once you get a feel of these, then you can move ahead with the embedded programming and use any of the development boards like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Beagle boards etc. There are plenty of them available in the market now. Try programming with those and make yourself aware of the possibilities with them. There is no limit in automating the things you like. Try making your own digital clock, a mini remote controlled car, automatic door lock, etc., it is unlimited to your imagination!

Secondly, this paragraph is for the engineering students who ask me what course should I pursue to get into the robotics field? I would frankly say that there is no particular course which you need to pursue to get into robotics. Choose your interest, like are you good at programming..? electronics…? Mechanical designs..? what not? Try to come to a conclusion in that and pursue the suitable course accordingly. It is the best way to get a focus in the beginning and move in the path ahead. If you get into any of the fundamental engineering course like Electroincs, Electrical, Mechanical or Computers you still have a chance to work with robotics! It’s basically how you relate your field of study to automate things around you. In robotics, an individual cannot do all the parts of the robot. There are specialized people who design the robot, who designs the circuit, who makes up the control system, embedded programming… and lot more. So you’ll be working as team to make a robot. It is a multi-disciplinary field. Anyone with the interest and passion can contribute to the robotics. Choose the field you really want to get your hands dirty on and start working on it!
  
Engineering students should feel proud that it is their opportunity to make this world a better place for the humanity. Think on all the problems which we are facing in our everyday life and try to come up with a solution as an engineer. Just think about it, what if every engineer who pass out every year contributes one good to the society?

To conclude this post, I would like to remind you all to focus on the field you really want to work on, set a path ahead and work hard to make your dream a reality.
